# Google Drive provider

## Setup
First, you need a GCP Service Account with [Domain Wide Delegation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/162106) set up with the Google Drive scope.

This provider uses [GSM](https://github.com/hanneshayashi/gsm)'s auth and drive packages.
You can take a look at the GSM [Setup Guide](https://gsm.hayashi-ke.online/setup), if you need help.

The basic steps are:
1. Create GCP Project
2. Enable Drive API
3. Create Service Account + Enable Domain Wide Delegation
    * See [Perform Google Workspace Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation)
    * **You don't need the Service Account Key if you want to use [Application Default Credential](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-for-using-and-managing-service-accounts#use-attached-service-accounts)
4. Enter the Client ID of the Service Account with the [Drive scope](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#drive) (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive) in your Admin Console

You can authenticate in one of two ways:
1. Create a Service Account Key and configure the provider like so:
```terraform
provider "gdrive" {
  service_account_key = "/path/to/sa.json"  # This is the path to your Service Account Key file or its content in JSON format
  subject             = "admin@example.com" # This is the user you want to impersonate with Domain Wide Delegation
}
```
2. Use Application Default Credentials:
Activate the [IAM Service Account Credentials API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/iamcredentials.googleapis.com/overview) *in the project where the Service Account is located*

   a) Use `gcloud auth application-default login` on your local workstation

   **or**

   b) Use a Google Compute Engine instance or [any service that supports attaching a Service Account in GCP](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/impersonating-service-accounts#attaching-new-resource)

In **both** cases, the account needs the *[Service Account Token Creator](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts#token-creator-role)* role for the Service Account you set up for DWD (**even if your GCP service is using the same account**).

You can then configure the provider like so:

```terraform
provider "gdrive" {
  service_account     = "email@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"  # This is the email address of your Service Account. You can leave this empty on GCP, if you want to use the service's account
  subject             = "admin@example.com"                         # This is the user you want to impersonate with Domain Wide Delegation
}
```

 ## Example Usage

```terraform
# Use a Service Account Key from a JSON file
provider "gdrive" {
  service_account_key = "/path/to/sa.json"
  subject             = "admin@example.com"
}

# Use Application Default Credentials
provider "gdrive" {
  subject = "admin@example.com"
}

# Use Application Default Credentials to impersonate a different Service Account
provider "gdrive" {
  service_account = "email@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  subject         = "admin@example.com"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `retry_on` (List of Number) A list of HTTP error codes you want the provider to retry on (e.g. 404).
- `service_account` (String) The email address of the Service Account you want to impersonate with Application Default Credentials (ADC).
Leave empty if you want to use the Service Account of a GCP service (GCE, Cloud Run, Cloud Build, etc) directly.<br>
You can also use the "SERVICE_ACCOUNT" environment variable.
- `service_account_key` (String) The path to or the content of a key file for your Service Account.
Leave empty if you want to use Application Default Credentials (ADC).<br>
You can also use the "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY" environment variable to store either the path to the key file or the key itself (in JSON format).
- `subject` (String) The email address of the Workspace user you want to impersonate with Domain Wide Delegation (DWD).<br>
You can also use the "SUBJECT" environment variable.
