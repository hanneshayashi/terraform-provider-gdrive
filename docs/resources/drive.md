## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the Shared Drive

### Optional

- `restrictions` (Block List, Max: 1) The restrictions that should be set on the Shared Drive (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--restrictions))
- `use_domain_admin_access` (Boolean) Use domain admin access
- `wait_after_create` (Number) The Drive API returns a Shared Drive object immediately after creation, even though it is often not ready or visibile in other APIS.
In order to prevent 404 errors after the creation of a Shared Drive, the provider will wait the specified number of seconds after the creation of a Shared Drive and before returning or attempting further operations.
This value is only used for the initial creation and not used for updates. Changing this value after the initial creation has no effect.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--restrictions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `restrictions`

Optional:

- `admin_managed_restrictions` (Boolean) Whether administrative privileges on this Shared Drive are required to modify restrictions
- `copy_requires_writer_permission` (Boolean) Whether the options to copy, print, or download files inside this Shared Drive, should be disabled for readers and commenters.
When this restriction is set to true, it will override the similarly named field to true for any file inside this Shared Drive
- `domain_users_only` (Boolean) Whether access to this Shared Drive and items inside this Shared Drive is restricted to users of the domain to which this Shared Drive belongs.
This restriction may be overridden by other sharing policies controlled outside of this Shared Drive
- `drive_members_only` (Boolean) Whether access to items inside this Shared Drive is restricted to its members

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import gdrive_drive.drive [driveId]
```
