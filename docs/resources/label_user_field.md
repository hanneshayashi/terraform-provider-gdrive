# gdrive_label_user_field (Resource)

Creates a User Field for a Drive Label.

Changes made to a Field must be published via the Field's Label before they are available for files.

Publishing can only be done via the Label resource, NOT the Field resources.

This means that, if you have Labels and Fields in the same Terraform configuration and you make changes
to the Fields you may have to apply twice in order to
1. Apply the changes to the Fields.
2. Publish the changes via the Label.

A Field must be deactivated before it can be deleted.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a Label
resource "gdrive_label" "test" {
  label_type       = "ADMIN"
  use_admin_access = true
  properties {
    title = "My Label"
  }
}

# Create a simple User Field
resource "gdrive_label_user_field" "field" {
  label_id         = gdrive_label.test.label_id
  use_admin_access = true
  properties {
    display_name = "My Field Name"
  }
}

# Create a second field before the first one that allows multiple selections
resource "gdrive_label_user_field" "field_multi" {
  label_id         = gdrive_label.test.label_id
  use_admin_access = true
  properties {
    display_name        = "My Field Name"
    insert_before_field = gdrive_label_user_field.field.field_id
  }
  user_options {
    list_options {
      max_entries = 2
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `label_id` (String) The ID of the label.

### Optional

- `language_code` (String) The BCP-47 language code to use for evaluating localized field labels.

When not specified, values in the default configured language are used.
- `life_cycle` (Block, Optional) The lifecycle state of an object, such as label, field, or choice.

The lifecycle enforces the following transitions:
* UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT (starting state)
* UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT -> PUBLISHED
* UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT -> (Deleted)
* PUBLISHED -> DISABLED
* DISABLED -> PUBLISHED
* DISABLED -> (Deleted) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--life_cycle))
- `properties` (Block, Optional) The basic properties of the field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--properties))
- `use_admin_access` (Boolean) Set to true in order to use the user's admin credentials.

The server verifies that the user is an admin for the label before allowing access.
- `user_options` (Block, Optional) User field options. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--user_options))

### Read-Only

- `field_id` (String) The key of the field, unique within a label or library.

This value is autogenerated. Matches the regex: ([a-zA-Z0-9])+
- `id` (String) The unique ID of this resource.
- `query_key` (String) The key to use when constructing Drive search queries to find files based on values defined for this field on files. For example, "{queryKey} > 2001-01-01".

<a id="nestedblock--life_cycle"></a>
### Nested Schema for `life_cycle`

Optional:

- `disabled_policy` (Block, Optional) The policy that governs how to show a disabled label, field, or selection choice. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--life_cycle--disabled_policy))
- `state` (String) The state of the object associated with this lifecycle.

<a id="nestedblock--life_cycle--disabled_policy"></a>
### Nested Schema for `life_cycle.disabled_policy`

Optional:

- `hide_in_search` (Boolean) Whether to hide this disabled object in the search menu for Drive items.

When false, the object is generally shown in the UI as disabled but it appears in the search results when searching for Drive items.
When true, the object is generally hidden in the UI when searching for Drive items.
- `show_in_apply` (Boolean) Whether to show this disabled object in the apply menu on Drive items.

When true, the object is generally shown in the UI as disabled and is unselectable.
When false, the object is generally hidden in the UI.



<a id="nestedblock--properties"></a>
### Nested Schema for `properties`

Required:

- `display_name` (String) The display text to show in the UI identifying this field.

Optional:

- `insert_before_field` (String) Insert or move this field before the indicated field.
If empty, the field is placed at the end of the list.
- `required` (Boolean) Whether the field should be marked as required.


<a id="nestedblock--user_options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `user_options`

Optional:

- `list_options` (Block, Optional) Options for a multi-valued variant of an associated field type. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--user_options--list_options))

<a id="nestedblock--user_options--list_options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `user_options.list_options`

Optional:

- `max_entries` (Number)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# The ID for this resource is a combined ID that consistent of the label_id and the field_id.
# If you file's fileId is "abcdef" and your field_id is "12345", the ID of the resource would be:
# "abcdef/12345"
# In addition, the use_admin_access attribute must be specified during the import.
# Example: true,abcdef/12345
terraform import gdrive_label_user_field.field [use_admin_access],[label_id]/[field_id]
```
