# gdrive_label_permission (Resource)

Updates a Label's permissions.

If a permission for the indicated principal doesn't exist, a new Label Permission is created, otherwise the existing permission is updated.

Permissions affect the Label resource as a whole, are not revisioned, and do not require publishing.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a Label
resource "gdrive_label" "test" {
  label_type       = "ADMIN"
  use_admin_access = true
  properties {
    title = "My Label"
  }
}

# Allow a specific User to apply the Label
resource "gdrive_label_permission" "permission" {
  parent           = gdrive_label.test.label_id
  use_admin_access = true
  email            = "user1@example.com"
  role             = "APPLIER"
}

# Allow everyone in the Org to apply the Label
resource "gdrive_label_permission" "permission_audience" {
  parent           = gdrive_label.test.label_id
  use_admin_access = true
  audience         = "audiences/default"
  role             = "APPLIER"
}
```

* ORGANIZER  - An organizer can pin this label in shared drives they manage and add new appliers to the label.
* EDITOR     - Editors can make any update including deleting the label which also deletes the associated Drive item metadata. Implies APPLIER.

### Optional

The magic value of 'audiences/default' may be used to apply the role to the default audience in the context of the organization that owns the Label.

User and Group permissions may only be inserted using email address.
- `use_admin_access` (Boolean) Set to true in order to use the user's admin credentials.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique ID of this resource.
- `name` (String) Resource name of this permission.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# The ID for this resource is a combined ID that consistent of the file_id and the label_id.
# If you file's file_id is "abcdef" and your label_id is "xzy", the ID of the resource would be:
# "abcdef/xzy"
terraform import gdrive_label_assignment.label_assignment [file_id]/[label_id]
```
